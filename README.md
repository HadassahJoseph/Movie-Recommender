**Project Brief / Idea**

Choosing an interesting movie to watch on a weekend evening is always hard. It would be great if there is a handy movie recommender to help you make a good decision.

In this guided project, you will be building such a personal movie recommender using the Django web framework. The movie recommendations will be generated based on your or your familyâ€™s 
previously watched movies. The recommendation algorithm included in this project is extremely simple but effective so you do not need any hardcore Machine Learning knowledge to 
understand and complete this project
